  The `run.py` is the key file to run the computational tool called 'ETSeq'. To run `run.py`, you need to prepare environment as below:
  * Create a python virtual environment named .venv

    `python -m venv .venv`
  
  * Activate your python virtual environment 

    Mac/Linux `source .venv/bin/activate`
    
    Windows `.venv/Scripts/activate.bat`
  * Install `Orange` to run `run.py`
  
    `pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine`

    `pip install orange3`

* Implement_LDLpipeline
